# watcher
Optional daemon which nodes can install to get up to date notifications and automated Analytics entries when a transaction occurs. Without watcher, entering received income for transaction forwarding is manual (e.g. “I confirm that I got X USD from A and will now proceed to send [the amount - % fee] to B”).
